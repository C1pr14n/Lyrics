This is an development in progress app with plenty of features, a Spotify like app where you can listen to your favourite music.

0. Run the app

   npm run dev
   ```

### If you want to help me with contributions:

1. To create a branch, use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>]`, where `base-branch-name` is optional and defaults to `main`.

   Use a standard convention for branch names. For example, `<your-name>-dev`. It will be easier to track your pull requests if you use this convention.

2. To create a pull request, you must have changes committed to your new branch.

3. Go to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-PRO/project1_team4_repository/pulls) and click on the `New Pull Request` button.

4. Select the `main` branch.

5. Click on the `Submit` button.

6. You have successfully created a pull request. Now wait for mentor approval. Once approved, you can merge the pull request.
